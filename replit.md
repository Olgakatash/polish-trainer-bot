# Polish Trainer Bot

## Overview

Polish Trainer Bot is an interactive console-based language learning application designed to help users learn Polish vocabulary through practice sessions. The application provides a simple command-line interface for vocabulary drilling, testing users on Polish-to-English translations across various categories including greetings, family terms, numbers, and colors.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Application Structure
- **Single-file architecture**: The entire application is contained within `polish_trainer_bot.py`, following a simple monolithic design pattern suitable for educational tools
- **Object-oriented design**: Uses a main `PolishTrainerBot` class to encapsulate all functionality and state management
- **Console-based interface**: Pure terminal/command-line interaction without GUI dependencies

### Data Management
- **In-memory vocabulary storage**: Polish-English word pairs are stored as a dictionary within the class, organized by semantic categories (greetings, family, numbers, colors)
- **No persistent storage**: Vocabulary data is hardcoded and reset on each application restart
- **Category-based organization**: Words are logically grouped to facilitate themed learning sessions

### Learning Methodology
- **Random selection**: Words are presented randomly to users to prevent memorization of sequence patterns
- **Immediate feedback**: Users receive instant confirmation of correct/incorrect answers
- **Simple scoring system**: Basic performance tracking during practice sessions

### Technology Stack
- **Python 3**: Core programming language
- **Standard library only**: No external dependencies, using built-in modules like `random`, `sys`, and `time`
- **Cross-platform compatibility**: Pure Python implementation runs on any system with Python 3

## External Dependencies

### Runtime Requirements
- **Python 3.x**: The application requires Python 3 interpreter
- **Standard library modules**: 
  - `random` for vocabulary shuffling
  - `sys` for system operations
  - `time` for timing functionality

### No External Services
- **Offline operation**: The application runs entirely offline with no network dependencies
- **No database connections**: All data is stored in-memory
- **No third-party APIs**: Self-contained learning experience without external service calls
